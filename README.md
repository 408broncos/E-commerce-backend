## Description 

For this project I was given a different approach and task list to complete. For this assignment I was asked to work on the back-end side of an already created application. The asks for this assignment were as follows: folders in insomnia for category/product/ tags, inside the folders there should be GET routes to display all categories/products/tags, the insomnia application should also display POST/PUT/DELETE routes to execute they're objectives by their id's.

## Code Examples

Here I will be showing an example of a section I was stuck on but eventually discovered the solution to:


```js
   }
  },
  {
    sequelize,
    timestamps: true,
    freezeTableName: true,
    underscored: true,
    modelName: 'category',
  }
);
```

I would say this assignment was a lot different than what we were previously given, but had its own challenges such as this one above. I struggled a lot understanding the format for sequelize and how and what to put in for this code. After a lot of research I was able to discover my solution, thanks to the website that I listed above, and discovered the how and what to input for this sequelize section.


## Usage 

For usages I used primarily a lot of the activities we worked on in class to help with the directions and to find the solutions to this assignment.


## Learning Points 

This assignment for me was a little easier than other assignments since we were first given a starter code that had a lot of it already done for us but with what we needed to input wasn't too hard to figure out. I would say that my skill with using mysql and node are becoming a lot easier to understand.
